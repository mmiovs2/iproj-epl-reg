English Premier League Transfer Market Valuation Regression

The goal of this analysis is to understand the relationship between player performance metrics and transfer market value in the English Premier League. As mentioned, transfer fees are often influenced by external factors such as contract duration and social media presence. This analysis narrows the focus to mainly on-field performance metrics such as goals scored, assists provided, and progressive carries. By using statistical modeling techniques, the project will explore how various metrics contribute to a playerâ€™s valuation. Furthermore, challenges such as high collinearity, variable selection, and assumption validation will be addressed to ensure a robust and interpretable model.
